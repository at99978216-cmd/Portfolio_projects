# Problem Statement – Business Insights 360

## Background
An FMCG organization operates across multiple functions such as Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive leadership. Each function tracks its own performance metrics, but data is scattered across multiple systems including databases and spreadsheets.

Due to the absence of a centralized analytics solution, decision-makers face challenges in monitoring overall business performance, identifying inefficiencies, and taking timely, data-driven actions.

## Business Challenges
- No single source of truth for cross-functional KPIs  
- Limited visibility into profitability drivers such as Gross Margin and deductions  
- Difficulty in evaluating forecast performance and supply chain accuracy  
- Manual and time-consuming reporting processes  
- Lack of interactive dashboards for executive-level decision-making  

## Objective
The objective of this project is to design and develop a **360-degree Power BI dashboard** that integrates large-scale transactional data and provides actionable insights across all major business functions.

## Expected Outcomes
- Centralized reporting for Finance, Sales, Marketing, Supply Chain, and Executive teams  
- Improved visibility into revenue, costs, margins, and forecast performance  
- Insights expected to:
  - Increase **Gross Margin % by ~10%**
  - Improve **Forecast Accuracy by ~15%**

## Scope
- Analyze real-world FMCG transactional data (~2 million records)  
- Build interactive and user-friendly Power BI reports  
- Enable data-driven decision-making while maintaining data confidentiality
